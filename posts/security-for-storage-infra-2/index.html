id="Introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Due to concerns about the length of the previous article <a href="/security-for-storage-infra">NIST SP 800-209 Security Guidelines for Storage (1) Threats and Risks</a>, a new post has been created to organize the content.</p>
<div class="note info flat"><p>The previous article primarily addressed threats, risks, and attack surfaces related to inventorying storage infrastructure. This article focuses on summarizing security recommendations for storage deployments. The contribution of this thesis lies in emphasizing measures that align with zero trust requirements and security standards such as SP800-209 related to data storage.</p>
</div>
<h1 id="4-Security-Guidelines-for-Storage-Deployments">4. Security Guidelines for Storage Deployments</h1>
<p>Sections 4.1 to 4.12 provide security recommendations and guidelines for storage infrastructure security. Each guideline is uniquely identified through a naming and numbering scheme, with the primary identifier taking the form of ‚Äú<em>xx-SS-Ry</em>.‚Äù</p>
<p>However, because this thesis focuses on security measures related to connections between AP (clients) and storage devices and the security measures of the hosts themselves, this chapter will not list all security recommendations but will only highlight those related to AP (clients) and storage devices or the ‚Äústorage infrastructure itself.‚Äù</p>
<div class="note info flat"><ol>
<li>‚Äúxx‚Äù represents two letter combinations related to the section title. For example, in section 4.1 ‚ÄúPhysical Storage Security,‚Äù the primary identifier is marked as PS-SS-R1, PS-SS-R2, etc.</li>
<li>‚ÄúSS‚Äù stands for ‚ÄúStorage Security.‚Äù</li>
<li>‚Äúy‚Äù is a consecutive numeric identifier, with further details denoted by ‚Äúa,‚Äù ‚Äúb,‚Äù such as ‚ÄòPS-SS-R1.a‚Äô (following NIST SP 800-53, section 3.10), ‚ÄòPS-SS-R1.b‚Äô (Supply Chain Protection), and so on.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="note warning flat"><p>My insight: This chapter can be used to compile a checklist for inspecting security measures related to AP, AP Hosts themselves, storage device Hosts themselves, and the connection between them. This checklist can be used as part of the authorization and access control process to mitigate potential security threats.</p>
</div>
<h1 id="4-1-PS-Physical-Storage-Security">4.1 (PS) Physical Storage Security</h1>
<p>Physical security is a fundamental element of ensuring the security of any information technology infrastructure. Often, requirements for the ‚Äúphysical security of storage infrastructure‚Äù align with those of other infrastructure elements, such as computers and network devices, including facility security, monitoring, and transportation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Relevant standards for infrastructure elements include NIST SP 800-53, Rev5, and NIST SP 800-171.</li>
<li>Further discussions on media disposal and destruction can be found in ISO 27040 and NIST SP 800-88.</li>
</ul>
<div class="note info flat"><p>Therefore, this chapter mainly provides regulations for ‚Äúphysical security unique to storage infrastructure‚Äù or aspects less emphasized in other publications.</p>

<ol>
<li><em>Data Backup and Recovery</em>: This is a crucial control measure to ensure data recovery after unexpected failures or catastrophic events.</li>
<li><em>Archiving</em>: This is a control measure to retain data in long-term storage, typically used for preserving historical data or data required by regulations.</li>
<li><em>Replication Technologies</em>: This involves creating data copies between different locations or systems as a control measure to ensure availability in case of primary system failures.</li>
<li><em>Continuous Data Protection</em>: This is a control measure that involves continuous monitoring of data changes and real-time backups, allowing for rapid recovery to specific points in time.</li>
<li><em>Point-in-Time Copies and Snapshots</em>: This control measure involves copying data at specific points in time for restoration or querying when needed.</li>

<h1 id="4-4-AL-Audit-Log">4.4 (AL) Audit Log</h1>
<p>Storage infrastructure components generate event log records for a large number of transactions or events. These event log records must be logged in some way for auditing purposes.</p>
<ul>
<li>From a <code>security</code> or <code>compliance</code> perspective, it is important to capture those necessary event log records to provide evidence of operations.</li>
<li>It enforces accountability and traceability, meets evidence requirements, and provides adequate monitoring of the system.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following are security-related audit log events:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>Administrative Events</code> - Related to the administration of system permissions.
<ul>
<li>For example, resetting user passwords, account creation/deletion, permission modifications, role changes, group membership changes, privilege operations, and configuration creation/changes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>Security-Related Events</code> - Events that can result in security incidents, such as changes to system security configurations and authorization error messages.
<ul>
<li>For example, changes to user configurations and security configurations, failed/block attempts to access storage, and blocked login attempts. These events are often of interest, although some may overlap with administrative events.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>Data Access Events</code> - Events related to data access, and monitoring access to sensitive information (e.g., determining what an adversary may have accessed) is helpful.</li>
</ol>
<p>The following are consequences of not properly documenting audit logs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Insufficient security logs and analysis allow attackers to hide their location, malware, and activities on victim machines.</li>
<li>Lack of reliable audit logs means that attacks can go undetected for an extended period, and the actual damage caused may be irreversible.</li>
<li>Due to poor or nonexistent log analysis processes, attackers can sometimes control victims‚Äô machines within the target organization for months or years without anyone in the target organization knowing, even though evidence of the attack could be in unreviewed log files.</li>
</ul>
<p>Given the criticality of event log data for attack detection and forensic investigations, here are security recommendations for implementing audit log functionality:</p>

<h1 id="4-7-IS-Isolation">4.7 (IS) Isolation</h1>
<p>When production data is damaged or lost, organizations should be able to recover the data through copies or backup data copies. If the damage results from malicious attacks, and the attacker can also destroy backup data copies, an attack on the production environment will have catastrophic consequences because the organization won‚Äôt be able to recover. To enhance the resilience of backup copies, <em>it should ensure sufficient isolation between data assets and their recovery copies</em>. In this context, organizations should differentiate at least two data protection scenarios:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Non-malicious Recovery</em> - Requires data copies to address scenarios like <code>natural disasters, hardware failures, human errors</code>, etc. These may include local copies (e.g., snapshots taken before maintenance), disaster recovery copies (DR copies), backups, and long-term archives. The closer these copies are to the production environment, the more likely they are mapped to compute systems for testing and disaster recovery.</li>
<li><em>Recovery from Network Attacks</em> - Requires <code>hardened, locked down, and isolated data copies</code>. Design should strive to achieve a state where these copies remain unaffected, even if associated production data volumes or other types of copies have been compromised.</li>

<ol>
<li>Use Infrastructure Encryption: Utilize built-in encryption features provided by disks, storage arrays, or cloud storage, whether using keys provided by vendors or keys provided by the organization, to protect against threats like device loss, misplacement, or theft. However, this may not protect against:
<ol>
<li>Insider Attacks - When an attacker infiltrates a host already associated with storage (or when storage can be mapped to an unauthorized host through legitimate means).</li>
<li>Privilege Escalation Attacks - Where administrators or attackers with high privileges may turn off encryption or decrypt data.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Use End-to-End Encryption: Data is encrypted at its source (e.g., applications, databases, volumes), and only ciphertext is presented to storage infrastructure and administrators. This significantly enhances security but may come with considerable costs:
<ol>
<li>Data Reduction Mechanisms Are Affected - For instance, compression and deduplication may become inefficient.</li>
<li>Management Becomes More Complex.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Use Dual Independent-Layer Encryption Where Possible: Consider using dual independent-layer encryption for stored sensitive data. This configuration enhances resilience if keys are compromised, especially when different encryption services are used.</li>
<li>Consider Data Retention Requirements: If ‚Äúencrypted data is backed up or archived,‚Äù related keys should be protected, and the protection duration should match that of the data.

<h1 id="4-10-AA-Administrative-Access">4.10 (AA) Administrative Access</h1>
<ul>
<li>This section focuses on <code>administrative access</code> to storage elements, including <em>arrays, networks and architectures, management tools, backups, replication, and cloud storage</em>, among others.</li>
<li>Administrative access can be achieved either by <code>directly connecting to storage components</code> or through <code>management software</code>. Both of these connection methods can use different interfaces, including graphical user interfaces (UIs), command-line interfaces (CLIs), and application programming interfaces (APIs).</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the recommendations in this chapter overlap with aspects related to administrative access. To avoid duplication, additional relevant recommendations can be found in the following two sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the previous section 4.9 Encryption, there are recommendations related to encryption.</li>
<li>In the previous section 4.3 Authentication and Data Access Control, there are recommendations related to data access control, some of which may also apply to administrative access.</li>
</ul>
<p>This section provides security guidelines for configuring administrative access, and the key points are summarized below:</p>
<details class="toggle" ><summary class="toggle-button" style="">Requirement: AA-SS-R1 - Limit Network Access to SAN Switch Management Ports</summary><div class="toggle-content"><ul>
<li>Limit <em>network access</em> to <code>SAN switch management ports</code> to <em>specifically assigned devices and administrators</em> using mechanisms like access control lists (ACLs).</li>
</ul>
</div></details>
<details class="toggle" ><summary class="toggle-button" style="">Requirement: AA-SS-R2 - Control and Minimize Components with Administrative Privileges</summary><div class="toggle-content"><p>This includes CLI servers, management consoles, API gateways, witness hosts, and storage devices with control privileges. Specifically:<br>
(a) Actively identify components with storage management privileges and ensure that only authorized components have these privileges. If unnecessary components are identified, they should be immediately removed and reported.<br>
(b) Remove unnecessary permissions and capabilities from authorized devices.</p>
</div></details>
<details class="toggle" ><summary class="toggle-button" style="">Requirement: AA-SS-R3 - Implement the Principle of Least Privilege</summary><div class="toggle-content"><ul>
<li>Restrict the <em>privileges of users with administrative access</em> to the <em>minimum necessary</em>.</li>
<li>This includes limiting the minimum actions users can perform and restricting the scope of these privileges to cover only relevant systems or areas.</li>
<li>Full administrative privileges should only be granted to users who require them.</li>
</ul>
</div></details>
<details class="toggle" ><summary class="toggle-button" style="">Requirement: AA-SS-R4 - Restrict Access for Service Accounts</summary><div class="toggle-content"><ul>
<li>Service accounts (e.g., accounts used by monitoring tools) should be restricted to <em>read-only</em> and <em>metadata-only access</em>.</li>
</ul>
</div></details>
<details class="toggle" ><summary class="toggle-button" style="">Requirement: AA-SS-R5 - Authenticate and Authorize All CLI/API Access</summary><div class="toggle-content"><ul>
<li>Authentication and authorization should be applied to <em>CLI/API</em> usage.</li>
<li>If authentication and authorization are not possible, additional security measures should be in place to protect unauthorized access, such as using privilege management tools to limit control to the minimum necessary commands and objects.</li>
</ul>
</div></details>
<details class="toggle" ><summary class="toggle-button" style="">Requirement: AA-SS-R6 ‚Äì Prefer API Access Control Over CLI/Shell Access</summary><div class="toggle-content"><ul>
<li><em>API access control should be prioritized</em>, as CLI/shell access has the capability to access the operating system and file system, including configuration files.</li>
<li>If CLI/shell access is the only option, it should be used over secure protocols like SSH.</li>
</ul>
</div></details>
<details class="toggle" ><summary class="toggle-button" style="">Requirement: AA-SS-R7 ‚Äì Restrict Operating System Privileges for Management Consoles</summary><div class="toggle-content"><ul>

</ul>
</div></details>
<details class="toggle" ><summary class="toggle-button" style="">Requirement: AA-SS-R9 ‚Äì Limit Host Storage Control Privileges</summary><div class="toggle-content"><ul>
<li>In certain shared data compute cluster configurations (e.g., clusters, geoclusters, scale sets, or storage virtualization infrastructure), hosts are granted management privileges over storage to control the allocation and behavior of shared cluster data resources.</li>
<li>When this management access is required, the scope and privileges granted to hosts should be limited to specific elements (e.g., LUNs, shares, files, objects) that the hosts need to control and specific operations they need to perform.</li>
</ul>
</div></details>
<details class="toggle" ><summary class="toggle-button" style="">Requirement: AA-SS-R10 ‚Äì Command Device or Gateway Configuration</summary><div class="toggle-content"><p>Some storage arrays allow hosts to have control over special block devices (referred to as ‚Äúcommand devices‚Äù and ‚Äúgateways‚Äù) that provide access to specific block devices. When used, the following security guidelines are recommended:<br>
(a) <em>Limit the use of control devices</em>: If feasible, eliminate the use of these devices entirely (e.g., switch to API access). If elimination is not possible, ensure that they are mapped only to necessary hosts (e.g., management hosts).<br>
(b) <em>Scan control devices</em>: Conduct network scans to discover control devices and ensure they are only mapped to necessary and authorized hosts.</p>
</div></details>
<details class="toggle" ><summary class="toggle-button" style="">Requirement: AA-SS-R11 ‚Äì Disable or Restrict Call Home or Remote Access</summary><div class="toggle-content"><p>Call home or remote access is typically used for collecting telemetry and diagnostic data for manufacturer analysis and resolution of technical issues, as well as for automatic software updates. However, these features can also become targets for hacking, so they should be <code>disabled if not needed</code> and <code>restricted and controlled if required</code>.<br>
(a) <em>Modify default credentials</em>: Change the default credentials for remote connections.<br>
(b) <em>Limit privileges</em>: Grant only the minimum necessary privileges.<br>
¬© <em>Enforce encryption</em>: Use secure protocols like TLS/SSH/IPsec and FIPS-approved encryption algorithms.<br>
(d) <em>Use an allow list to restrict access</em>: Use an allow list to restrict access to specific IPs and users.<br>
(e) <em>Maintain complete logs of remote access</em>: For audit purposes, all remote access should be fully logged.<br>
(f) <em>Enable built-in data obfuscation features</em>: For storage devices that allow obfuscation of sensitive data (such as IP addresses, WWNs, device names, and usernames), this feature should be enabled.<br>
(g) <em>Limit the scope of data sent</em>: Limit the scope of data sent to the minimum required.<br>
(h) <em>Regularly review and approve</em>: Regularly review data sent to vendors either periodically or automatically, ensuring that it does not contain sensitive information like IP addresses, usernames, or actual storage device content. Also, review to ensure that connections go to valid vendor IP addresses.<br>
(i) <em>Authorize each connection</em>: If possible, implement a mechanism that requests permission before allowing each connection.<br>
(j) <em>Limit access to gateway systems</em>: Special attention should be paid to protecting and restricting access to gateway systems when vendors access them remotely through devices, servers, or appliances.<br>
(k) <em>Disable software updates over vendor remote access links</em>: In sensitive environments, software components and updates should not be allowed to be downloaded and deployed over vendor remote access links (either manually or automatically).</p>

<li>It is recommended to <em>separate management networks from other traffic</em> (see sections 4.6 and 4.7).</li>
<li>Further <em>enhance access control for management networks</em>, which can be achieved through the following mechanisms:<br>
(a) Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), IPsec, or one or more ‚Äújump servers‚Äù: Use VPNs, IPsec, or one or more ‚Äújump servers‚Äù or ‚Äúlogin proxy servers,‚Äù which are dedicated servers located in the management network and can only be accessed from outside the network.

<li>This includes the following:
<ul>
<li><code>Configuration files</code>: Record users and roles, network settings, consistency groups, device groups, and other storage options. Configuration files defining consistency and device groups are typically automatically propagated from central management hosts to other hosts connected to managed storage systems. Therefore, if compromised, it could affect multiple systems.</li>
<li><code>Scripts</code>: Used to control the startup, monitoring, and stopping of storage management services and daemons, as well as their own executables. These scripts and other critical management-related files should be securely protected.</li>

<h1 id="4-11-CM-Configuration-Management">4.11 (CM) Configuration Management</h1>
<p>The purpose of configuration management is to provide visibility and control over the configuration, behavior, and physical and logical attributes of the entire storage device throughout its <em>lifecycle</em>. In the context of storage security, this includes the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maintaining a comprehensive and real-time <em>inventory</em>, managing changes, and ensuring that configurations <em>continuously adhere to the organization‚Äôs security baseline and current industry best practices</em>, while also ensuring they are not vulnerable to known risks.</li>
</ul>
